If you want to use it from a fixed location, use the name (or part of a name, case-insensitive) or [ID](https://citybikes.github.io/stations.txt) of a station or lat/lon coordinates:

 * https://citybikes.github.io/?name=rautatientori
 * https://citybikes.github.io/?id=A23
 * https://citybikes.github.io/?lat=60.168333&lon=24.95625
